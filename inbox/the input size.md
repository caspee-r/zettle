>	"The best notion for input size depends on the problem being studied"

>For many problems, such as sorting or computing discrete Fourier transforms, the most natural measure is the number of items in the inputâ€”for example, the array size n for sorting. For many other problems, such as multiplying two integers, the best measure of input size is the total number of bits needed to represent the input in ordinary binary notation. Sometimes, it is more appropriate to describe the size of the input with two numbers rather than one. For instance, if the input to an algorithm is a graph, the input size can be described by the numbers of vertices and edges in the graph. We shall indicate which input size measure is being used with each problem we study.
