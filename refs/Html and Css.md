#### the begin
first of all, when the *world wide web* was under develop and design , it was need a way to **link** different pages witch eachother and a standar way to describe the structure of that page which we call it now a *web page* therefore, html came to the screen as a hypertext markup languge to describe the web pages stracture and layout .though html was laking to styling , and the better solution is to make another languge dedicated to styling the web pages and be able to embeded into the html code. and  this languge is the css(cascade style sheet)
#### html history 
html firsly hosts in CERN then IETF  for it's first 5 years with the creation of **W3C** html development changed again, an extended version of it was realised as html3.0 then html 3.2 , html 4 followed ,  reaching completion in 1998.
at this time W3C turn its attention into making a new xml-based languge as a replacement for html called *XHTML* , moreover, W3C introduce XHTML1.0 and then XHTML2.0 which was not compatible with first version. suddenly a publication from  **XFORM** which was talking about the next technologie for the web forms , and this sparked a new interest into developing html which her developing was stoped in 2003 , and the argument of xform her is xml can't support new technologies like *rss or atom*.
this push the browser vendors mozilla and opera to send a proposal to W3C to reopen the development oh html.
this argument was rejected  and they continue the devolement of hxml . this leads individual from apple , mozilla and opera to work under the umbrella of a new venue called the WHATWG .
in 2006 W3C decided to work with WHATWG and continue the html5 develpment .

#### css history
- Like HTML, CSS is standardized by the W3 consortium
- css1.0 was introduces after 5 year from html
- css  developed to format html and xml properties and layouts
- css gives a great solution for stayling web pages rather than specify each element style in html
