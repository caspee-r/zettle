# The Five Attributes of a Complex System


there are five attributes common to all complex systems.
## Hierarchic Structure
>` Frequently, complexity takes the form of a hierarchy, whereby a complex system is composed of interrelated subsystems that have in turn their own subsystems, and so on, until some lowest level of elementary components is reached ` - courtois

many *complex systems* have a *decomposable hierarchic
structure* which make it easy for us to understand it and it's components 
each complex system contains subsystems which in turns have other subsystems and *the relation* between those components is what's **add the value** 

## Relative Primitives
the primitive components in a systems are relative to the *observer* so they may differ for another observer

## Separation of Concerns
there is a difference between the intra-components and the inter-components interactions which provide a clear **separation of concerns** among the part of the system so we can study each part in *relative isolation*

## Common Patterns
> `Hierarchic systems are usually composed of only a few different kinds of subsystems in various combinations and arrangements`
Ibid., p. 221

this mean that in software system we *common pattern* that may reuse other small components or reuse large component e.x vascular systems, also found in both plants and animals. 

## Stable Intermediate Forms
a stable intermediate form provide to the complex software the speed to evolve from simple system , furthermore, a complex system always have to *evolve* from a simple system that worked, or it will never work.
as the system evolve, *complex object* will be the primitive blocks which more complexity will be on top of them
