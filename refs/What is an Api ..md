"Application Programming Interface" . an api is the *interface* that a program provide to others programs or human for interacting with it . APIs designed to work with other Programs 

# Why we need Apis?
we need **apis** because we need to exchange data with other providers who worked on a solution for our problem , instead of reinventing the wheel we use apis to make our life easier and take advantage of other existing technologies. for instance if i need a mapping system for my app i will use google map api .

# Who are our users?
When we build an api we have to focus on our users and this will saves us from an api that no one will use
because the cost of redesign an Api is high for most developers . we need to set the  specification   of our api before implement it
